# Data Engineer Coding Assignment


## Organisation
- Solutions to the coding assignment is in the jupyter notebook titled `PNL_test_1.ipynb`. 
    - The notebook has detailed comments on each task and sub-task. 
    - Incase there are issues with opening the note book, I have exported the file as a markdown, HTLM and a python file with the same name.
- `updown.py` contains wrapper functions for the Dropbox API and can be ignored.
